# Before we start 

We will need the following:

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
- (Optional) Follow the steps [here](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/) to verify the installation.  
 


DBeaver is just the IDE (development environment). It has the `Chinook` database that we will use. If you prefer to use another IDE, [download](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) the `Chinook` database.
